Salary Predictor web app using Python and Streamlit
## 
I am creating a ML project to predict salary given years of work experience. Here I have 3 modules:
  

a) Homepage --> where a plot of salary with exp is plotted on historical data.  
b) Prediction --> I am simply training model using Linear Regression and predicting on user input.  
c) Contribute to dataset --> taking user inputs to enrich our dataset for better predictions.
